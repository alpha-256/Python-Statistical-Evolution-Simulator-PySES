There were two men from a place called egulac
And they were going next to a river and it was pretty foggy, it was pretty calm
but suddenly canoe appeared full of five men and these five men were conversing with each other and asked each other, What do you think about these two men and they said Yeah we should take them to war
And they other two men on the shore thought it was a war party so they were conversing between each other and they were deciding, should we go and make war on the people and one of two men did not want to go because his relatives did not know where he was so he went back to his own village and the other young men he went along with them and they made war on the people.
After they made war on the people, one of the young men returned and they and thought he was injured and they felt that they were seeing his ghost but it was actually a gunshot, and his face became contorted and the people started screaming and then he died.
